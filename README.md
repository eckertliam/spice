# The Spice Programming Language
#### Author: Liam Eckert
I plan for Spice to be a stripped down ML inspired language with macros. I do not plan for Spice v0.0 to have macros but will instead implement the entire macro system in spice.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add language spec to README
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] System verification: ensuring there is no undefined behavior
- [ ] EIRCE or Endless Intermediate Representation Called EIRCE
- [ ] Finish AST for the parser
- [ ] System to generate EIRCE from AST
- [ ] System to generate Python from Eirce
- [ ] Workout all the kinks and bugs that popup
- [ ] Officially release Spicelang version 0.0
- [ ] Write a std lib for Spice
- [ ] Write Spicelang version 0.1 in Spicelang
- [ ] Work out FFI
