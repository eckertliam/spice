# The Spice Language

The Spice Language is inspired by MLs such as Ocaml and SML. The Spice Language is not meant to be used for anything serious, it is only a project for me to learn from. I have been working on Spice for a long time now, I have imagined Spice many different ways during that time. Finally I have decided on these key features for Spice:

1.  [Hindley-Milner typse system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)
2.  The goal of the syntax is to maximize readability.
3.  A powerful macro system with lisp style expansions, symbols, and eval.
4.  Generates C for the code generation.
5.  A REPL for interactive development.

Many of these features will only be implemented during the bootstrapping period when I write the Spice compiler in Spice.
