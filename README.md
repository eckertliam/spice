# The Spice Language
The Spice Language is inspired by MLs such as Ocaml and SML. The Spice Language is not meant to be used for anything serious, it is only a project for me to learn from. I have been working on Spice for a long time now, I have imagined Spice many different ways during that time. Finally I have decided on these key features for SPice:

1. A [Hindley Milner Type System](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/0022000078900144?token=2A89C89B99265C0A3D9376F871D6EFA21F164179E19A189587F1878F51D06B93B424901E661FE1A9419465A51F85D4FA&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20220724022935).
2. A syntax similar to javascript.
3. A powerful macro system with lisp style expansions, symbols, and eval
4. Generates C for the code generation
5. A repl

Many of these features will only be implemented during the bootstrapping period when I write the Spice compiler in Spice.
